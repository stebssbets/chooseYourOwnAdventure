    Albert was a dude. But he wasn't quite sure if he felt like a dude.  There really wasn't anyone around him to talk
    about his gender identity.  Which brought him to a cross road.  Should he bottle up his feelings of gender ambiguity
    or open up to his friend, Bill about it.

    Should Albert?
